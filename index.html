            Hi my name is Ravi Patel. I graduated from Souther Illinois University Carbondale in 2012 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Automotive Technology. After I graduated SIU, I stated working for a private insurance company in the Automotive claims department. At this time I realized that the automotive industry is moving more and more towards automated and self-driving cars. Thatâ€™s when I decided to change my career path from working for a private insurance company to want to become a developer and a programer that would allow me to one day work with a company like Tesla Motors. I started looking for ways to understand and learn to become a developer and a programer. During that search I came across a bootcamp that teaches how to develop web applications, phone applications, and programs. I enrolled into this bootcamp that will help become a developer to start my new career path. After completing the program I want to one day achieve my goal at work for a big automaker like Tesla motors that changed the Automotive industry and want to be part of a big innovative ideas that will change the way this world looks at cars or any modes of transportation.
